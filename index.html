<h4>About Me</h4>
<section class="aboutMe">

<img src="img/blackandwhiteheadshot.jpeg" class="aboutMeimg" >

<p>"I am a focused UX/UI Designer, with an intuitive eye that knows how to blend engaging aesthetics with functionality. At my core, I identify as a creative artist. Apart from designing, I'm also involved in teaching music, writing, storytelling, painting and previously produced and hosted a ghost story podcast.
    My interests span solving puzzles and delving into psychology, including hypnotherapy and neurolinguistic programming, in which I hold a master certification. My strength is in brainstorming, user research and problem solving. My career transition to  UX/UI  from a background in the mortgage industry has  given me an aptitude for great attention to detail, crossfunctional teamwork, presentations, as well as creating marketing campaigns. I understand the psychology of the user and strive to make technology more enjoyable.</p>
